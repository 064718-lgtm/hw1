# CRISP-DM Methodology Steps for the Linear Regression Project

This document outlines the steps of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) as applied to this simple linear regression project.

### 1. Business Understanding

*   **Objective**: To understand and visualize the relationship between two variables using a simple linear model (`y = ax + b`).
*   **Goal**: Create an interactive tool that allows users to see how changing the underlying parameters of a dataset affects the performance of a regression model.
*   **Success Criteria**: A functional web application where a user can modify data generation parameters and immediately see the updated model and its evaluation.

### 2. Data Understanding

*   **Initial Data Collection**: Since we don't have a pre-existing dataset, we generate synthetic data. This gives us full control over the data's characteristics.
*   **Data Exploration**: The application provides a scatter plot to visualize the generated data. This helps in understanding the relationship between the feature (X) and the target (y), as well as the level of noise.
*   **Data Quality**: The generated data is clean by design, so no cleaning is necessary. In a real-world project, this step would involve handling missing values, outliers, etc.

### 3. Data Preparation

*   **Data Selection**: We use all the generated data for training the model.
*   **Data Formatting**: The data is structured into a pandas DataFrame with two columns: "Feature (X)" and "Target (y)". This is the standard format required by scikit-learn's modeling functions.
*   **Data Transformation**: The feature `X` is a 1D array, which is reshaped into a 2D array to meet the input requirements of the `LinearRegression` model in scikit-learn.

### 4. Modeling

*   **Modeling Technique**: We select Simple Linear Regression because the goal is to model a linear relationship between a single feature and a target.
*   **Model Training**: We use the `LinearRegression` class from the `scikit-learn` library. The `fit()` method is called on the prepared data to train the model, which calculates the optimal slope (`a`) and intercept (`b`).
*   **Parameter Tuning**: In this project, we are not tuning the model's hyperparameters. Instead, we are tuning the *data's* parameters to see how the model adapts.

### 5. Evaluation

*   **Evaluation Metrics**: We assess the model's performance using two standard regression metrics:
    *   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.
    *   **R-squared (RÂ²)**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model.
*   **Visualization**: The performance is also evaluated visually by plotting the learned regression line over the original data points. This gives an intuitive sense of how well the model fits the data.

### 6. Deployment

*   **Deployment Strategy**: The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
*   **User Interface**: The application provides a user-friendly interface with sliders and plots, allowing non-technical users to interact with the model and understand its behavior.
*   **Monitoring and Maintenance**: In a real-world scenario, this step would involve monitoring the model's performance over time and retraining it as needed. For this project, the deployment is self-contained and does not require ongoing monitoring.
