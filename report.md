# Project Report: Simple Linear Regression Application

## 1. Introduction

This report summarizes the work done to create a simple linear regression application as per the initial request. The project's primary goal was to develop an interactive web application to demonstrate the principles of linear regression following the CRISP-DM methodology.

## 2. Project Execution and CRISP-DM

The project was structured around the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), and the application itself is organized to reflect these stages:

-   **Business Understanding**: The app clearly states the objective of modeling linear relationships.
-   **Data Understanding & Preparation**: An interactive interface allows for the generation and visualization of synthetic data. Users can control parameters like slope, intercept, noise, and the number of data points.
-   **Modeling**: A `scikit-learn` `LinearRegression` model is trained on the user-generated data in real-time.
-   **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated and displayed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics. A plot of the regression line provides a clear visual assessment.
-   **Deployment**: The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing an accessible and interactive experience for the end-user.

## 3. Deliverables

The following files were created to complete the project:

-   `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies (`streamlit`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`).
-   `app.py`: The core Streamlit application containing the logic for data generation, modeling, evaluation, and the user interface.
-   `README.md`: Provides a general overview of the project, along with setup and usage instructions.
-   `step.md`: A detailed document explaining how each step of the CRISP-DM framework was applied in this project.
-   `log.md`: A complete log of the conversation and commands used to build the project.

## 4. Version Control

The entire project was version-controlled using Git and pushed to the following GitHub repository:
`https://github.com/064718-lgtm/hw1.git`

## 5. Conclusion

The project successfully meets all the initial requirements. The resulting Streamlit application serves as an effective educational tool for demonstrating the fundamentals of simple linear regression and the structured approach of the CRISP-DM process.
